# Python DSA reminder
## Datastructures and algorithms using python

*This code is not made for dummies*
*The develper created it a a DSA reminder*
*Some expirince with DSA is needed*
**Most of the code has been learnt from udemy**

**So far the DSA code consists of**
*Recusion
    1.Fibonachi
    2.Factorial
*Big O notation
    1.Time complexity
    2.Space complexity
